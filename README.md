# leaflet-challenge

This project is a visualization of earthquake data from the United State Geological Survey using Leaflet geomapping. The map shows all earthquakes in the past 24 hours that have a magnitude of 1.0 or higher. The greater the magnitude of the earthquake the bigger the marker and the darker the color. To see the magnitude and location of each earthquake click on the marker and a pop up box will display this information. The data source and therefore the map are update every minute.
